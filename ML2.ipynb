    "## Methods Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Two most common types of recommender systems are **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users’ attitude to items, that is it uses the \"wisdom of the crowd\" to recommend items. \n",
    "* Content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective). The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "CF can be divided into **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Model-Based Collaborative filtering**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.\n",
    "\n",

Model-based CF methods are scalable and can deal with higher sparsity level than memory-based models, but also suffer when new users or items that don't have any ratings enter the system.

    "Model-based Collaborative Filtering is based on **matrix factorization (MF)** which has received greater exposure, mainly as an unsupervised learning method for latent variable decomposition and dimensionality reduction. Matrix factorization is widely used for recommender systems where it can deal better with scalability and sparsity than Memory-based CF. The goal of MF is to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items. \n",
    "When you have a very sparse matrix, with a lot of dimensions, by doing matrix factorization you can restructure the  user-item matrix into low-rank structure, and you can represent the matrix by the multiplication of two low-rank matrices, where the rows contain the latent vector. You fit this matrix to approximate your original matrix, as closely as possible, by multiplying the low-rank matrices together, which fills in the entries missing in the original matrix.\n",

By applying matrix factorization the model learns that important user features are _age group (under 10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-90)_, _location_ and _gender_, and for movie features it learns that _decade_, _director_ and _actor_ are most important. Now if you look into the information you have stored, there is no such feature as the _decade_, but the model can learn on its own. The important aspect is that the CF model only uses data (user_id, movie_id, rating) to learn the latent features. If there is little data available model-based CF model will predict poorly, since it will be more difficult to learn the latent features. \n",

    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "### So what is TF-IDF?\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for *term frequency-inverse document frequency*, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf-idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the tf-idf weight is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF: Term Frequency**, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization: \n",
    "\n",
    "*TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).*\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDF: Inverse Document Frequency**, which measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "*IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).*\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 / 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.\n",
